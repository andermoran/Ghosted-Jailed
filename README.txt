What this does?
- Reverts the unpleasant changes made to the Snapchat's feed. NO JAILBREAK REQUIRED.

I don't know how to use Impactor!
- Article on how to use it (https://www.cydiageeks.com/download-cydia-impactor-install-apps.html)
- Video on how to use it (just look it up on youtube)

Instructions:
- Remove Snapchat
- Install/Update Impactor (http://www.cydiaimpactor.com)
- Drag "Snapchat_v10.26.0_andermoran_oldfeed.ipa" into impactor and install
- Login to Snapchat
- Do all the notification stuff
- Quit the snapchat app (double click home and swipe up)
- Open Snapchat
- Done! The old feed is back!

What do I do if it didn't work?
- Google the error codes Impactor is giving you and figure it out
- If the app is not trusted than google that error. It's a simple fix

Extra:
- How? I did this by patching the Snapchat binary
- Haven't posted a write up on how exactly I did this. DM me if you're interested and I'll make a write up
